                        The United States of America has a serious eating problem, and it might not be the kind of eating problem that usually comes to mind.
                        Did you know it is estimated that as many as 31 million people in the U.S. skip breakfast every day? A recent study by the National
                        Purchase Diary Panel found that as many as 28% of males between the ages of 18-34 skip breakfast regularly (the statistic is 18% for
                        females in the same age group.) This is a big problem because the International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science and the Harvard
                        School of Public Health both list breakfast as the most important meal of the day.<br><br>

                        Well, the brilliant minds over at Team 1 have come up with a solution to this glaring issue. That solution is Easy Breakfast&trade;!
                        &Prime;What is Easy Breakfast&trade;?&Prime; you ask. Well, Easy Breakfast&trade; is a one stop recipe application that will make preparing breakfast
                        a breeze. The programmers over at Easy Breakfast are working day and night to make a simple program that will help any hungry
                        breakfasteer put together a fabulous breakfast in mere minutes. By choosing from a simple pre-defined list of ingredients and
                        clicking go, breakfasteers will be able to see a list of recipes and the extra ingredients they need to make the most important
                        meal of the day a tasty reality!

                    <p>
                        The aim of the design is to eliminate the deficiency of power outlets by providing a product of guaranteed potential and protection that eases the process of charging
                        multiple electronic devices through a sole power supply. The design could consist of multiple module stacks, depending on consumer’s need. Excluding the base module,
                        all constituent modules consist of similar inner and outer parts. The major parts, found in all the modules, include a circuit board, a connector, and an external
                        shell made of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. Due to the simplicity of the design, it is not expected to consume much time nor resources during the
                        construction process. We would be using a miniature amount of inexpensive yet quality materials to provide consumers with a reasonably priced product. The total
                        cost that is predicted to be spent per product is approximately &#36;8, without the consideration of labor and other overhead expenses. The estimated time snap to complete
                        the entire project, from case design through sales, is roughly 6 months. Regarding the analysis, we plan to focus on the carrying capacity and stress between each
                        module’s connector to define the maximum capacity our connector can withstand without losing its functionality.

                        Despite the availability of adequate power plugs in almost all public and private places, the problem of having numerous devices to recharge and the deficiency of as
                        many power outlets to satisfy this growing demand is still a lingering issue. We might have witnessed or even have been held responsible for the action of using a
                        laptop to charge other USB devices. Even though this activity is justified by many experts to not cause any concerning damage to either of the devices, some studies
                        suggest that we do not get into the habit of charging our phones or other electronics devices through a USB connected to our PC as it might take about 1/10th of the
                        laptop&prime;s charge. The more justifiable reason to avoid this habit would be the fact that our device will takes twice as much time if we choose to use our laptops as
                        our main current source charge than when using than the original power outlet. The idea for our conceptual design spurred from the demand to charge all our digital
                        gadgets using a simple yet efficient adapter wherever we might me.  on the carrying capacity and stress between each
                        module&prime;s connector to define the maximum capacity our connector can withstand without losing its functionality.

                    <h2>Requirements overview and summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        The prime requirement is for our design to be able to charge/recharge different electronic devices with the guarantied amount of power labeled on each module. For that
                        to be possible there got to be a decent connecting system between each module and the main power outlet. Regarding mobility and appearance, the external feature would
                        have to agree with the internal components to give out an ergonomic product. We will be using parallel circuiting to minimize the total amount of space to be taken by
                        wires and other components that are part of the conductive system, while still attaining the maximum current. We also plan to gear our modular charger with spare
                        rechargeable batteries that could take the job of the main outlet in times of power blackout or simply lack of power outlet at the time.

                    <h2>Requirements overview and summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our project consists of 4 unique subsystems: Internal Module Design, Exterior Design, Connector Design, and Additional Module Design. Internal Module Design consists of
                        circuit design and internal mounting locations and is headed by JJ Mase. Exterior Design, headed by Maria Jembere, defines the module&prime;s aesthetics and ergonomics to ensure
                        a seamless user experience. Connector Design, headed by Raul Garcia, encapsulates the design of the physical connector to interface between the device&prime;s differing modules.
                        Lastly, Additional Module Design, headed by Enrique Alvillar, outlines the additional modules necessary for the modular ecosystem to function, including battery and base modules.
                        <br><br>Internal Module Design satisfies requirement 3 and its lower level requirements and works towards optimum charging speeds on USB Type A and Type C and QI Quick Charge support. Exterior
                        Design satisfies requirement 1 and its lower level requirements, attempting a footprint of 4&Prime; x 4&Prime; x 4&Prime; or smaller. Additional Module Design satisfies requirement 4 and its lower level
                        requirements. Additional Module Design inherits requirement 2.2 from Connector Design, given Additional Module Design creates the AC plug block. Lastly, Connector Design satisfies
                        requirement 2 and its lower level requirements, leaving requirement 2.2 for Additional Module Design, as mentioned earlier. The connector developed by the Connector Design subsystem will
                        be embedded in each block in the modular charger.

                    <h2>Analysis introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main characteristic that distinguishes our charger is its ability to be stacked either vertically or horizontally. In either case, the design characteristics change with the orientation
                        chosen to accumulate each module. It is important to remember that all connections, be they permanent or removable, have a limit on the forces they can sustain before failing. For a removable
                        connection failure rarely means the breaking of the mating parts but rather their separation. For our design this second situation is the one that was analyzed. What type of loading is required
                        to cause the assembled modules to separate? And likewise, how strong must their connections be to avoid separation?
